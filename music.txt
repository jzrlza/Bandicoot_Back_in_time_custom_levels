Crash Bandicoot - Back In Time Fan Game: Custom Level: Manual Switchy By Jzrlza

Since Terry didn't played this level, I decided to do this one myself, some levels can be too much for time or he does not play time trial levels at all.

Level Name: 
Difficulty: Normal
Collectibles: :crystal: :Gem: :gem3:
Version: 0.95
Description: 

Level Name: Aku Craze
Difficulty: Hard
Collectibles: :Gem: :gem3:
Version: 0.95
Description: When using invincibility of Aku-Aku is mandatory but also isn't always flat out easy? This is the level that challenge the morality of the Aku-Invinciblity while getting both gems. Death route can be accessed even dying before, but the real route requires tight slide one-block trick. Also the falling blocks part is inspired by "Space Blocked" by Dannyh09

Level Name: Check Your Checkpoints
Difficulty: Normal
Collectibles: :Gem: :gem3:
Version: 0.95
Description: Make your the checkpoints you need to activate for gems won't trap you in death loop limbo or soft-locks, the level is fairly simple for most parts and not too long, the death route is very early in the level (also if complete it, has a portal to teleport back to beginning or can go to finish, your choice) with some juicy hints of where it is.

Level Name: Minecraft Hardcore Emerald
Difficulty: Normal
Collectibles: :Gem: :GemG:
Version: 0.95
Description: Simulation of Minecraft Hardcore into Bandicoot world, but levels are mostly straightorward simple, there are few sections in order;l cave, plains, biomes, nether, skyblock, village. Note that dying once before green gem and checkpoint will trap you in lava box, which are near the end, make sure to preserve Aku masks for the skyblock and village parts as invincibility makes it easier there.

Level Name: Deep Blue Dive Pow
Difficulty: Normal
Collectibles: :Gem: :GemB:
Version: 0.95
Description: Blue pow, blue gem, one break, breaks all but outlined, including the player if break before blue gem.

Level Name: Too Many Helps From Aku Aku
Difficulty: Hard
Collectibles: :Gem: :GemY:
Version: 0.95
Description: Aku Aku is good right? Not always this time, "invincibility" can now easily kill you in this level, this is a damage-puzzle level, sometimes getting hurt is needed to progress. Death route becomes forgiving after first checkpoint due to its unusal activation mechanics.

Level Name: Crash Red Handed
Difficulty: Normal
Collectibles: :Gem: :GemR:
Version: 0.95
Description: Red gem is in front of you, first thing you gonna to is collect it and see what happens for yourself... perhaps too soon, what in front of you perhaps requires death-free alternate route??

Level Name: Ze Boss Rush
Difficulty: Hard
Collectibles: :GemP:
Version: 0.95
Description: 3 mutant bosses in 5 HPs at once with forced Aku invincibility against them, the roof is where you recharge your aku mask, but watch out for Uka mask at the top for 2 sections. Cortex is waiting for you after an iron checkpoint crate, but he's 2 HP due to technical issues. Defeat them all to gain purple gem (enemies kill counter also tels you), if any one of them stuck, you must die to reset.

----------------------------

Level Name: Nitro Til The End
Difficulty: Normal
Collectibles: :Gem: :GemB:
Version: 0.95
Description: Bouncy nitro level, short but require good jump timing and positioning.

Level Name: Between Red Green
Difficulty: Normal
Collectibles: :Gem: :GemY:
Version: 0.95

Level Name: Heat Of Permian Plants
Difficulty: Normal
Collectibles: :Gem: :GemR: :gem3:
Version: 0.95
Description: Back in Time... to Permian, pre-dinosaur time where, in ficitious bandicoot world, plants are immune to fire.
Bosses: (red gem route at end) Koala, Tiny each 5 HP, no need to kill them, just escape past them for black gem.

Level Name: Neo Chaos City
Difficulty: Normal
Collectibles: :Gem: :GemG: :gem3:
Version: 0.95
Description: Forward in Time... to Neo (Cortex) era, you have lots of Aku's forsight in this level, things are easy until after getting green gem.

Level Name: Ze BanditCoot Bounty
Difficulty: Hard
Collectibles: :Gem: :GemP: :gem3:
Version: 0.95
Description: It is dark arabian level where you have to kill all enemies (not proximity to nitro), including bosses all 4 at once at the end (luckily they are 1 hp now), bandit-coots got bounties on their head indeed. Luckily fireflies and Aku-Aku crates all around to help the bandit-coots.
Bosses: (second death route at end)  Koala, Tiny, Ripper, Cortex each 1 HP, kill them for purple gem, easier than it sounds.



Level Name: Slide Collision
Difficulty: Hard
Collectibles: :Gem:
Version: 0.95
Description: Not to be confused with the CTR track name "Slide Collusuem"... anyways, this level is about mixing ice platforms with treadmill platforms and see how they megamix together. *The ice cracking platforms are tricky, especially when they teamed with ice stalagmites against the switch crates , but here's the hint: once you step on it, it cracks but not yet break, touch it again will break it (if so, instant jump might save you out of it), you can slide over them, but after slide, do not stop there so that it will not break, take that in mind.*

Level Name: Portal Is A Lie
Difficulty: Hard
Collectibles: :Gem: :gem3:
Version: 0.95
Description: Portal cake meme reference level, but with teleports as your enemy, checkpoints also demands your life for its cost.
