Collectibles: :crystal: :Gem: :GemB: :gem3:
Version: 0.95
Description: Breakable crates now also into pipe fashion, note that some locked crates and nitro bouncers can be destroyed by nitro due to their special conditions in the level. Also the blue gem requires life sacrifice and iron platform from slot crates temporary until death.

Level Name: Plumber Check
Difficulty: Easy
Collectibles: :crystal: :Gem: :GemY:
Version: 0.95
Description: The machines are what operating the sewer, preserve them until yellow gem is gotten, that will be the key to solve plumbing further on, maybe... The level is easy, short, straightforward, nothing stands out.

Level Name: Rat Crashing
Difficulty: Hard
Collectibles: :crystal: :Gem: :GemP: :gem3:
Version: 0.95
Description: Kill all pests in the sewer. Also dying once will not nullify skull route cuz you land on spawn to make it forgiving, but at the same time, all the 3 gems require you to take the skull route.
