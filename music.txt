Level Name: Slide Collision
Difficulty: Hard
Collectibles: :Gem:
Version: 0.95
Description: Not to be confused with the CTR track name "Slide Collusuem"... anyways, this level is about mixing ice platforms with treadmill platforms and see how they megamix together. *The ice cracking platforms are tricky, especially when they teamed with ice stalagmites against the switch crates , but here's the hint: once you step on it, it cracks but not yet break, touch it again will break it (if so, instant jump might save you out of it), you can slide over them, but after slide, do not stop there so that it will not break, take that in mind.*

Level Name: Portal Is A Lie
Difficulty: Hard
Collectibles: :Gem: :gem3:
Version: 0.95
Description: Portal cake meme reference level, but with teleports as your enemy, checkpoints also demands your life for its cost.
